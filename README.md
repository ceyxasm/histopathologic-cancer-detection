# histopathologic-cancer-detection

Modern medical image processing techniques work on histopathology images captured
by a microscope, and then analyze them by using different algorithms and methods. Machine
learning algorithms are now being used for processing medical imagery and pathological tools.
Manual detection of a cancer cell is a tiresome task and involves human error, and hence
computer-aided mechanisms are applied to obtain better results as compared with manual
pathological detection systems.

In this project, we perform exploratory
analysis on the data and try out different models to give the best results.
